# LanceDB eBPF Programs

This repo contains [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/) programs that can be used to
observe application behaviour.

The maps may follow conventions to expose metrics to [bumblebee](https://github.com/solo-io/bumblebee). 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/solo-io/bumblebee/blob/main/docs/concepts.md).
